== Description

Tracing ruby applications with LTTng.

A simple API for sending tracepoints from Ruby programs to LTTng.

== Requirements

Ruby 2.0 or newer

== Installation

You need to have the +lttng-ust+ library and headers installed on your system to build this.

== Use

The documentation for lttng will be useful for understanding how to make good use
of this gem. http://lttng.org/docs/



  $ lttng create
  $ lttng enable-channel channel0 -u
  $ lttng enable-event 'ruby_log:*' -u -c channel0
  $ lttng start
  $ my-ruby-program.rb
  $ lttng stop
  $ lttng view | less
  $ lttng destroy

Note that logs aren't deleted when you run +lttng destroy+, only the lttng session.
The logs are stored by default in +~/lttng-traces+.

=== Simplest possible use:

  LTTng.info("This string should be logged in lttng.")

=== Conforming to Ruby's built-in Logger class API:

  require 'lttng-agent-ruby'
  require 'lttng-agent-ruby/logger'
  logger = LTTngLogger.new
  logger.info("Something informative")

Note that the standard 'formatter' attribute is present for compatibility
with applications that expect it to be present, but has no effect when
used.

=== With the built-in TracePoint class:

  require 'lttng-agent-ruby'
  require 'lttng-agent-ruby/logger'
  require 'tracer'
  tracer = TracePoint.new() {|tp| LTTng.debug(tp.inspect) }
  tracer.enable

Be careful about the span of your program covered by tracing at this level;
this can use up disk space at alarming rates!

== Parsing libraries

Until I can provide a more comprehensive tool, I've put together a couple
libraries that can parse the output of the http://www.efficios.com/babeltrace[babeltrace] tool.

Using these parsers requires that you have the 'parslet' gem installed, but as
it's not a hard requirement for using the core facilities of LTTng, it's not
a dependency.
